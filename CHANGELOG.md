# Pulumi Console Requests Changelog

The goal of this file is to provide a timely record of improvements we make in response to the public console
requests tracker for the Pulumi Console.

- We should update this file each time an issue from the `pulumi/console-requests` repo is addressed, adding
  a note about whatever cool, new feature was added that month.
- Please be descriptive enough so that somebody unfamiliar with the Pulumi Console codebase will
  understand what new feature or ability was added. i.e. describe things in terms of what users
  can do, and link to any relevant PRs or bugs for more context.

## November, 2021

- Add a "Copy to Clipboard" button for project and stack output and configuration values.  [#8](https://github.com/pulumi/console-requests/issues/8)
